Match The Colors is a concentration/memory match puzzle game.

When you click "play," you'll be presented with two different game types: easy and hard.

When you first start a game, easy or hard, you'll be presented with a grid of "cards" that are "flipped."

Clicking on a card will "flip" it and reveal the color underneath the card.

The objective is to match cards of the same color.

If the cards that you flip match in color, they will remain flipped up.
If they do not match, they will be flipped back over.

In easy mode, the objective is to match two cards of the same color.
Failing to find a pair will lose the player a turn, successfully finding a pair will not.
You're allowed to fail 20 times before the game ends and you lose.

In hard mode, the objective is to match three cards of the same color.
Failing to find a match of three will lose the player a turn, successfully finding a match of three will gain the player a turn.
You start with 20 allowed failed attempts, but can gain more by successfully finding matches.
Losing all of your attempts will end the game and cause a loss.

Both easy and hard game modes can be played in single-player or local two-player modes.
In order to play two-player mode, click the check box in the top right corner when selecting a difficulty.

In two-player mode, players take turns attempting to make matches.
Once it is a player's turn, the player continues attempting to match cards until he/she fails to make a match.
Upon failure to make a match, control is then given to the other player.
This process is repeated until all cards have been matched.
There are no lives/attempts in two-player mode.
At the end of the game, the player who made the most matches wins.
